Find the time to go through the top stories at hacker news or the relevant subreddits (e.g. /r/programming, /r/php, /r/javascript etc) on reddit, trending projects on Github (may be using some browser extension). Once again, follow the known-faces of your craft on twitter and on Github.

## Have some side project

Side projects are great when it comes to experimenting the new stuff or the stuff that you don't know about. Keep some little time reserved for your side projects, either over the weekend or on daily basis. It could be anything i.e. something opensource or start that foolish idea that you have always wanted to start using the tools that you may never have worked with. This will help you get two-fold benefits; if it works, well in good, if it doesn't; never mind you learnt something new.

Don't lose your sanity
The interesting thing about the web is, it is changing all the time and the bad thing about is, it is changing all the frigging time. All that frustration that is caused whenever something new pops up; you haven't settled yet and lo and behold there is something new that you have to deal with. It is not difficult to lose sanity with all that is happening around so how do you stay sane? Well the key idea is to ignore all that fuss and focus the stuff at hand. Do not try to be a know-it-all guy, although it won't hurt to be informed about what is new in the market and a little bit about how it compares with the tools that you are using currently; do not jump right in, learn as you need. Most of them won't really see the light of the day.

While I say that, do not let this be your excuse when it comes to the updates to your current stack, for example if you are a PHP developer and you come to know that PHP-7 has been released and you ignore it by saying "Step aside, I am staying sane, PHP-5.6 is all good".

Write if you can
Stop thinking that writing for programmers is the wastage of time and doesn't add much to your belt, it does and does that without you noticing much. For example, A; it It helps you get better at writing, obviously, B; knowing that you are going to put something in the public for others to see, you are forced to thoroughly understand the topic that you are about to write so it not only helps others but yourself also, C; self-marketing, a potential employer can get a much better idea about you from your blog than from your CV, D; blogging about the personal experiences and about how you solved a specific issue not only help others but may also help you down the road when you might face the same issue again to name a few.

But be sure to keep in mind that, if done badly, blogging can be a negative thing for you and could potentially leave you open to criticism and hold you up as an object or ridicule. So if you plan on doing it, you better do it right.

See where you are going
Focus on the long term goals, do a self reflection from time to time in order to see where you are headed to and what can you do to improve. If you don't see yourself improving and see nothing much ahead of the road, there is something seriously wrong and you definitely need to juggle a few things around for your own betterment.

And that about wraps it up. What are your thoughts for the self-improvement, do not forget to share them using the comments section below. Until next time, stay tuned.

The Bottom line advice
Here's a summary of the advice given in the text:

Stay informed: Follow relevant blogs, websites, and social media accounts related to your field to keep up with the latest trends and developments. Examples include Hacker News, Reddit subreddits such as /r/programming, /r/php, /r/javascript, trending projects on GitHub, and known figures in your craft on Twitter and GitHub.

Work on side projects: Set aside time to experiment with new technologies or concepts that you're not familiar with through side projects. These can be open-source or personal ideas that help you learn and grow.

Maintain sanity: Avoid getting overwhelmed by the constant changes in the web development world. Focus on what's important and learn as needed, rather than trying to keep up with everything at once. However, don't ignore updates to your current stack.

Write if you can: Writing for programmers is beneficial, helping improve writing skills, deepening understanding of topics, self-marketing, and more. Be mindful that poor writing could have negative consequences.

Plan for the future: Reflect on your progress regularly to identify areas for improvement and set long-term goals. If you feel stuck or see no room for growth, consider adjusting your approach.Ô∏è
